# MulTaBench

> **Work in progress:** MulTaBench is moving towards a living leaderboard, and `master` will change
> gradually on the way there. To reproduce the paper, use the tag

A benchmark for multimodal tabular learning: tables whose columns include images or free text, not
just numbers and categories. It is 20 image-tabular and 20 text-tabular curated datasets, with 40
further datasets released alongside them, 80 in total. The benchmark evaluates tabular learners
under a target-aware setting, where the image and text encoders are fine-tuned on the task rather
than used frozen.

## Getting started

```bash
source init.sh && source .venv/bin/activate
cp .env.example .env     # Hugging Face and Kaggle credentials

python benchmark.py --model light --dataset_name MUL_IMAGE_PETFINDER --fold 0 --multimodal_state all
```

`benchmark.py` is the single entry point: it evaluates one model on one dataset fold and writes the
result to `runs/<model>_<dataset>_<state>_<fold>.json` (`--output_dir` to change). `--help` lists
the available models; `--multimodal_state` is `all` (frozen encoders) or `ft` (the dataset's image
or text encoder fine-tuned on the task).

## Datasets

Every dataset is hosted on the [`chico89`](https://www.kaggle.com/chico89/datasets) Kaggle account
and downloaded on demand; the benchmark datasets are slugged `multabench-<name>` and the ones
released alongside them `multabench-full-<name>`.

| What you are looking for | Where it is |
|--------------------------|-------------|
| Which datasets are in the benchmark | `is_benchmark_dataset` in `multabench/datasets/all_datasets.py` |
| A dataset's Kaggle slug | `MulTaBenchDatasetID` in `multabench/datasets/all_datasets.py` |
| Where a dataset originally comes from | `MULTABENCH_SOURCES` in `multabench/datasets/all_datasets.py` |
| How a dataset was curated | the recipes in `multabench/benchmark/datasets/` at the [`paper_version`](https://github.com/alanarazi7/MulTaBench/tree/paper_version) tag |
| Size, task and feature counts per dataset | `multabench/leaderboard/results/datasets_summary{,_extra}.csv` at the [`paper_version`](https://github.com/alanarazi7/MulTaBench/tree/paper_version) tag |

The 40 datasets released alongside the benchmark were admitted on a weaker criterion and carry no
tier name of their own, so their scores must not be pooled with the 40 MulTaBench datasets.
